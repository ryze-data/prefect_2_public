# Blocks

Blocks are a primitive within Prefect that enable the storage of configuration and provide an interface for interacting with external systems.  

## Built-in Blocks

These are blocks that you can just import without requiring any additional python package installs via pip.

## Integrations

Some Blocks are considered integrations. Integrations are extensions of prefect for a particular external system. Because they are an extension, they are downloadable via pip install. These are collections of tasks, flows, and blocks to help interact with the external system.
